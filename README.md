# visjs-bubble
This is Bubble chart using Vis.js.

In this project, I added dragging, moving, zooming, clustering functionalities.
## VisJS
A dynamic, browser based visualization library. The library is designed to be easy to use, to handle large amounts of dynamic data, and to enable manipulation of and interaction with the data. The library consists of the components DataSet, Timeline, Network, Graph2d and Graph3d.
## Modules
- [Network](http://visjs.org/docs/network/) : Display dynamic, automatically organised, customizable network views.
- [Timeline](http://visjs.org/docs/timeline/) : Create a fully customizable, interactive timeline with items and ranges.
- [Graph2d](http://visjs.org/docs/graph2d/) : Draw graphs and bar charts on an interactive timeline and personalize it the way you want.
- [Graph3d](http://visjs.org/docs/graph3d/) : Create interactive, animated 3d graphs. Surfaces, lines, dots and block styling out of the box.
- [Dataset](http://visjs.org/docs/data/) : Manage unstructured data using DataSet. Add, update, and remove data, and listen for changes in the data.
